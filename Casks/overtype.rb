  caveats <<~EOS
    Overtype.app is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. On first launch macOS
    Gatekeeper may block it. If so, remove the quarantine attribute:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Overtype.app"

    Overtype needs Accessibility permission to read and replace selected text:
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility

    You must re-grant that permission after every upgrade. macOS ties the
    permission to the app's code signature, and an ad-hoc signature changes
    with each build, so the old entry stays listed and enabled but no longer
    works. Select Overtype in that list, remove it with the "-" button, then
    add the upgraded app and enable it again.
